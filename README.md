# Welcome to Lux ✨

Computational modeling can be an expensive task, especially for healthcare institutions. Moreover, current mathematical analysis tools for oncology-related complexities can be inefficient and costly. Lux is a mobile application programmed to simplify statistic forecasting for tumor growth, heterogeneity, and various immunotherapies, including Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL/CD8⁺ T) treatments, and CTL/CD8⁺ T-cell treatments assisted by CD4⁺ T-cell stimulation.

## Introduction

Lux is the first software program in the Luminosity project series. The main objective of Luminosity is to expose the uncertainties of cancer progression in the human body in order to minimize potential risks. Tumor growth is complex and involves various factors that must be taken into consideration in order to accurately predict its development. Examples include the tumor microenvironment (TME) and angiogenesis. The intrinsic diversity present in cancer tissue, however, is effectively represented by spatial heterogeneity and biological entropy. This is why Lux was designed to analyze entropy values for gradient densities.

In addition, immunotherapy can involve many kinds of cell types, including lymphocytes T and B, natural killer (NK) cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The first version of Lux has been programmed to model three case scenarios, which have been studied to be choice therapies for various tumor types. The combination of these growth factors can describe at the basic level how tumors mature and reduce with applied treatment plans.
